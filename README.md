## Introduction

Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), API routes, and more. This repository contains several examples and small projects to help solidify my understanding of Next.js.

Projects include:
- Building dynamic routes
- Server-side rendering
- Static site generation
- API Routes in Next.js
- Client-side state management with React hooks

## Features

- **File-based routing**: Learn how Next.js automatically generates routes based on the file structure.
- **Dynamic Routes**: Handle dynamic URL parameters with `getServerSideProps` and `getStaticProps`.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Build pages at build time for fast loading.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Render pages at request time for up-to-date data.
- **API Routes**: Create backend API endpoints directly inside Next.js.
- **React Hooks**: Use `useState`, `useEffect`, and other hooks for managing state and lifecycle events.
- **CSS Modules & TailwindCSS**: Utilize modern CSS frameworks for styling.
- **Deploying to Vercel**: Learn how to deploy a Next.js app to Vercel.

## Prerequisites
